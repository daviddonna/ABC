"""
Implememntation of the artificial bee colony algorithm (Karaboga, 2005).

An artificial bee colony has the following features:

    workers   -- number of worker bees,
    observers -- number of observer bees,
    solutions -- a set of solutions, one for each worker bee
    alpha     -- a variance factor
    fitness   -- a fitness function
    mutate    -- a mutation function

Each iteration of the algorithm consists of the following steps:

    For each worker:
        Create a mutated copy of the solution (see the Vector.mutate docs).
        If the mutant's fitness is better than that of the solution,
            replace the solution with the mutant
            and refresh its attempt counter.
            If the mutant's fitness is better than the best seen so far,
                replace the current best solution with the mutant.
        If not, decrement the solution's attempt counter.
        
    For each observer:
        Select one of the workers' solutions,
            with probability proportional to its fitness.
        Work on that solution, as in the worker phase.

    For each solution:
        If the solution's attempt counter has hit 0,
            reinitialize the solution as a random vector.
